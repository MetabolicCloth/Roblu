# Roblu
Streamline your team's scouting procedure with Roblu, a scouting app for robotics competitions focused on customization, simplicity, and functionality. Note: This project is still in the testing phase, although it is usable, it still may contain bugs and
inconsistencies. Help support this project by downloading the app and testing / suggestioning new features. The goal is to have a
bug free, and not only functional, but beautiful, efficient, concise, and intuitive scouting solution.

# Features
## Organization using events
Roblu is not designed for a specific year of FRC robotics, it's designed to be adaptable to any year. This is accomplished through events. Events contain an array of teams, matches, and scouting information. Information can be searched, filtered, organized, and synced to your team mates. Roblu supports unlimited event creation, so you can review historical scouting data.
## Powerful, useful, and relevant forms. Forms, your way
Custom forms allow you to create your own take on how scouting should be done Through custom forms, you can create and organize
elements to display information that you need while you need it. Currently, Roblu supports the following elements: boolean, counter, slider, chooser, checkbox, stopwatch, textfield, and image gallery. Roblu supports two form types: PIT and match forms. PIT forms contain general, single instance data about a team while match forms contain infomration determined from a team's performance in a match. Forms can be edited at any time to meet your team's scouting needs. Forms can be manually created or choosen from a predefined list. Roblu supports a "master form", so multiple events can share the same form. 
## Syncing, safety in numbers (coming soon)
Syncing sets Roblu apart from all other scouting apps. The mission statement for Roblu syncing is simplicity. As syncing is one of the most valuable and useful features for teams, we wanted to do it right. Bullet points are cool:  
* Syncing is accomplished through Amazon Cloud Services, so you can expect world class security and stablilty
* The head of scouting on your team can use the Roblu master app to deliver "assignments" to scouters, assignments will show up on Roblu client apps and allow scouters to easily input information.
## Streamlined, simple team models
At a base level, scouting relies on representing a team's skill and performance quickly and easily with a efficient team model.
Roblu does just that with its streamlined team model. Each team contains a overview tab, an automatically generated view which displays analytical information, such as graphs, historical data, and team information. Each team contains a PIT tab which displays general information. Finally, each team can contain an unlimited amount of match tabs. A match prediction tab is generated automatically for you. Using TBA integration, Roblu automatically adds matches to a team that they are in for an event. 
## Powerful Analytics
Roblu analytics are under construction currently, but will contain powerful tools for analyzing information and informing the user
with relevant information. Analytics will include features such as: tables, graphs, historical data, rankings, comparisons, artifical
intelligence and machine learning.
## TBA Integration
Roblu makes use of huge amounts of online data available through thebluealliance.com. Roblu has it's own powerful TBA-API, so 
TBA integration is smooth and stable. With TBA integration, event can be easily imported with teams, matches, and more. TBA integration will save you from wasting time on things such as creating a list of teams and instead allow you to get straight into things that matter.
## CSV!
Roblu has got you covered when it comes to spreadsheets. Roblu supports exporting of ALL event data into multiple sheets with condensed data. Currently under construction is a custom CSV programming langauge, with this language, your team can specify an export configuration so Roblu knows how to export your data, and where. Roblu exports all those fancy colors too.
# License
How does all the legal stuff related to Roblu help you? First off, Roblu is copyrighted, so other people can't pawn Roblu's code off and upload clone apps. When you use Roblu, we want to make sure that you're using the authentic Roblu.  

If your team wants to download the Roblu source code, go for it! Go ahead and make modificiations that will help you scout better. However, you aren't allowed to distribute a modified version of Roblu to anyone except your own team. 

If you modify Roblu, all I ask is that you indicate what you changed in a text file in your source code, with a link to this repo (https://github.com/techguy9984/roblu).
